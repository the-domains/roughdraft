Repeat after me: 

Intention is the key that opens the door to life.

Say it again. And again. And again. Until you start to act with intention.

Much of our life is lived as an automaton, eat, work, Netflix, sleep. Our choices are predetermined by our habits. The power of habit is strong enough to guide your captain-less ship directly into the rocks if you're not careful.

However, habits when forged with the willpower of intention can steer that ship instead to adventure, paradise and safely through the worst storms as the waves try to smash you.

I know. I've had my ship smashed to pieces by shitty circumstances and a directionless life guided by bad habits.
